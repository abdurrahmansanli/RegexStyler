# RegexStyler
I wrote a simple regex styler to enable markdown like custom styles for attributed strings.

Currently there are 2 styles: highlight & underline. You can simply add new styles using attributed string extensions.

## How to use

Simply decide a special character for a style and use this special character at leading and trailing of words you'd like to style.
For example; my special character is: `|`
I can underline animal names in following sentence as follows:
```The quick brown |fox| jumps over the lazy |dog|.```
